# ENGR415-MechatronicsFinal


The purpose this mechatronic system is to incorporate teleoperation from a remote setting between three team members participating in an operation where two masters (user input control) and a standby (processes the commands given) perform an operation like game.

The operation objective is to have a standby operator that can designate which master operator can take control of the manipulator. The two master operators will declare how the teleoperation manipulator will be controlled, while the other teammate, who is the standby operator, provides tele-feedback to the master operator to accomplish its mission task. 

Both the master and standby operators may not communicate with each other through visual camera or audio microphone/speaker. The only form of communication may be through wireless network through the form of analog to digital communication to a web server.
